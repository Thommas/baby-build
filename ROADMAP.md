### Build

A build is the following:
- For each month a list of quests

- Setting goals for each month and each year

### Month

- Past will record stats and consolidate build
- Present will present stuff to introduce to the child

### Laziness

Monitor each month the amount of laziness of your child.
We want to prevent passively watching TV or youtube for instance.
Same for video game with empty gameplay (Candy crush)

### Quest

- Main quest
- Bonus quests

The goal is to encourage curiosity.

Type of quest:

Examples:
- At 6 year old pick a book (dinosaur, planets, flowers)
- At 9 year old pick a sport and register to local club (basket, tennis, soccer)
- At 12 year old pick an instrument (piano, guitar, other)

Finishing quest grants XP.

When the child level up, the parent can give points to primary and secondary attributes.
Primary and secondary attributes to be defined.

  We have a whole generation of parents who have no idea what hardcore gaming is.
  They should know how to put limits.
  childs mimics parent behavior, it's important to show a good example.
