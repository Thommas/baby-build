3) Digital content

- board game
- online video (spend X hours on youtube only whitelisted playlist)

4) Life tutorial

Parents accumulate knowledge with experience and wants to give a summary
for their children to access at some point in their life.
Create life tutorial dedicated to your child in the future.

Examples:

- How to manage a car

5) Time capsule congratulation message

Store date it was written.

6) Build hidden achievement unlockable

Should be a short message.

7) Give some exploration time

Allow full access to internet with privacy
Should be unlocked as a reward and time should increase progressively
Permanent reward system with gauge

8) Eat oishii food

9) The child can ask for a reward

### Goal

Can create as many goal as we want for each month/year.
The goal is a milestone to completing the full build.

### Quest

All quests must help follow the build goals while giving alternative opportunities.
Quests are designed to encourage curiosity.

Types:
- Main: mandatory quest that the child should complete
- Bonus: optional the child can skip it
- Hidden: quest hidden to the child but that he might complete without knowing it

A quest should always have 3 choices.
But we might have to define the choices later.
We don't know in advance which sport club the child might be able to join.
If empty, choices will be defined when quest is activated.

Examples:
- At 6 year old pick a book (dinosaur, planets, flowers)
- At 9 year old pick a sport and register to local club (basket, tennis, soccer)
- At 12 year old pick an instrument (piano, guitar, other)

### Child

Finishing quest and reaching goals grant XP.

When the child level up, the parent can give points to primary and secondary attributes.
Primary and secondary attributes to be defined.
