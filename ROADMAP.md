### Goal

Can create as many goal as we want for each month/year.
The goal is a milestone to completing the full build.

### Quest

All quests must help follow the build goals while giving alternative opportunities.
Quests are designed to encourage curiosity.

Types:
- Main: mandatory quest that the child should complete
- Bonus: optional the child can skip it
- Hidden: quest hidden to the child but that he might complete without knowing it

A quest should always have 3 choices.
But we might have to define the choices later.
We don't know in advance which sport club the child might be able to join.
If empty, choices will be defined when quest is activated.

Examples:
- At 6 year old pick a book (dinosaur, planets, flowers)
- At 9 year old pick a sport and register to local club (basket, tennis, soccer)
- At 12 year old pick an instrument (piano, guitar, other)

### Child

Finishing quest and reaching goals grant XP.

When the child level up, the parent can give points to primary and secondary attributes.
Primary and secondary attributes to be defined.
