Modules

#### Build

The goal is to encourage curiosity.

- How often (per year, per month, per 6 month) ?
- Prepare possibilities and choices

Examples:
1) Pick a book (dinosaur, planets, flowers)
2) Pick an instrument (piano, guitar, other)
3) Pick a sport and register to local club (basket, tennis, soccer)

Everytime the child makes a choice, he will get XP and level up.
When the child level up, the parent can give points to primary and secondary attributes.
Primary and secondary attributes to be defined.

#### Whitelist

Whitelist media contents to give access to the child. Each content will have a minimum age required.

Contents can be:
- books
- movies
- tv show
- anime
- video game
- board game
- online video

#### Life tutorial

Parents accumulate knowledge with experience and wants to give a summary
for their children to access at some point in their life.
Create life tutorial dedicated to your child in the future.

Example:
1) How to deal with an aggressive girlfriend or boyfriend
2) How to manage a car

#### Laziness meter

- Mesure laziness vs effort with reward system

Monitor each day/week the amount of laziness of your child.
We want to prevent passively watching TV or youtube for instance.
Same for video game with empty gameplay (Candy crush)

Also when the child levels up, the parents can decide to reward his or her curiosity
by providing access to more technology and media contents.


Goals
-----

- Lack of technology control leads to bad growth
- Lack of interaction (parent let their child on tv instead of doing an activity with them)
- Dopamine control (cultivate depth instead of short interaction)
- Not too much control (balance big brother vs security concerns)
- Make access to technology a reward
- Need community tools
- Gender equity
- Allow specific culture, religion, belief, family traditions


Stack
-----

- Test many visualization libraries
- Need unique identifier for youtube video/book/anime/tv show/movie/video game/boardgame


Other
-----

- Thema for each year ?
- Primary and secondary stats +1 per year
- Parent also level up for every interaction with the platform
- Allow other family member to input data
- Make a list of what this platform should not be used for
- Lots of stories of parents who let their child play 10 hours per day.
  We have a whole generation of parents who have no idea what hardcore gaming is.
  They should know how to put limits.
  childs mimics parent behavior, it's important to show a good example.
